## 1. Capitalize
      Take a sentence as input.
      Split it into individual words.
      Capitalize the first letter of each word.
      Join the capitalized words back into a sentence.
      Return the final sentence.
      
## 2. Introduction-to-sets
      Take a list of integers as input.
      Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set.
      Calculate the sum of unique elements.
      Divide the sum by the number of unique elements.
      Return the result as a float.
      
## 3. Text-wrap
      Take a string and a maximum width as input.
      Break the string into parts, each of the given width.
      Return the string.
      
## 4. Alphabet-rangoli
      Choose a size n to build the rangoli.
      Prepare a list of alphabets from 'a' to 'z'.
      For each row (top half + center), pick symmetrical alphabets around the center.
      Join them with dashes and center-align each row based on required width.
      Mirror the top half to create the bottom half.
      Print all rows to display the full rangoli.

## 5. Merge-the-tools
      Take a string and a segment length k as input.
      Split the string into equal parts of length k.
      For each part, remove repeated characters while keeping the order.
      Print each cleaned segment on a new line.

## 6. Collections-counter
      Take the total number of shoes and their sizes as input.

## 7. Exceptions
      Take the number of test cases.
      For each test case:
      Read two values, A and B.
      Try to divide A by B using integer division.
      If theres an error (like dividing by zero or invalid input), print the error message.
      Else print the division result.
      
## 8. Incorrect-regex
      Read the number of test cases.
      For each pattern:
      Check if two repeat operators (*, +, ?) appear one after another.
      If they do, its invalid.
      Print True if the pattern is valid, otherwise False.
      
## 9. Set-discard-remove-pop
      Read the number of elements and store the set.
      Take the number of commands to perform.
      For each command:
      If its pop, remove a random element.
      If its remove x, delete x.
      If its discard x, delete x.
      After all commands, print the sum of the remaining set elements.
